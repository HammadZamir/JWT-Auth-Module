JWT Authentication Module
This repository contains a full-stack implementation of JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and ReactJS. The module is designed to handle user authentication for web applications, with features such as user registration, login, and access to protected routes. Additionally, it includes form validation implemented in ReactJS.

Features
User Registration: Allows new users to sign up with a valid email and password.
User Login: Authenticates users and issues a JWT token upon successful login.
Protected Routes: Restricts access to specific routes based on user authentication.
Form Validation: Validates user input in forms, such as email and password, ensuring data integrity.
Token Storage: Stores JWT in HTTP-only cookies or local storage for secure authentication.
User Roles: Supports different user roles for access control.
Logout: Allows users to log out, invalidating the JWT token.
Technologies Used
Backend:
Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB with Mongoose
JWT (jsonwebtoken)
bcrypt.js (for password hashing)
Frontend:
ReactJS
Axios (for HTTP requests)
React Router (for routing)
Other:
dotenv (for environment variables)
Postman (for API testing)
Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js
MongoDB
npm or yarn
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jwt-authentication-module.git
cd jwt-authentication-module
Backend Setup
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the following:

bash
Copy code
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
Run the backend server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the frontend development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Usage
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
Register a new user, log in, and explore the authenticated routes.
Form Validation
Form validation is implemented in the ReactJS frontend to ensure data integrity:

Email Validation: Checks for proper email format.
Password Validation: Ensures the password meets minimum length requirements and matches the confirm password field.
Example Validation Code
Here's a brief snippet showing how form validation is handled:


Security Considerations
Use HTTPS to secure JWT transmission.
Store JWTs in HTTP-only cookies for enhanced security.
Regularly rotate JWT secret keys.
Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
