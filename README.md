JWT Authentication Module
=========================

Overview
--------

This repository contains a full-stack implementation of JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and ReactJS. The module is designed to handle user authentication for web applications, with features such as user registration, login, and access to protected routes. Additionally, it includes form validation implemented in ReactJS.

Features
--------

* **User Registration**: Allows new users to sign up with a valid email and password.
* **User Login**: Authenticates users and issues a JWT token upon successful login.
* **Protected Routes**: Restricts access to specific routes based on user authentication.
* **Form Validation**: Validates user input in forms, such as email and password, ensuring data integrity.
* **Token Storage**: Stores JWT in HTTP-only cookies or local storage for secure authentication.
* **User Roles**: Supports different user roles for access control.
* **Logout**: Allows users to log out, invalidating the JWT token.

Technologies Used
-----------------

### Backend:

* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB with Mongoose
* JWT (jsonwebtoken)
* bcrypt.js (for password hashing)

### Frontend:

* ReactJS
* Axios (for HTTP requests)
* React Router (for routing)

### Other:

* dotenv (for environment variables)
* Postman (for API testing)

Installation
------------

### Prerequisites

* Node.js
* MongoDB
* npm or yarn

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jwt-authentication-module.git
cd jwt-authentication-module
```

### Backend Setup

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

2. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following:

    ```bash
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    ```

3. Run the backend server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

Usage
-----

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Register a new user, log in, and explore the authenticated routes.

Form Validation
---------------

Form validation is implemented in the ReactJS frontend to ensure data integrity:

* **Email Validation**: Checks for proper email format.
* **Password Validation**: Ensures the password meets minimum length requirements and matches the confirm password field.

### Example Validation Code

Here's a brief snippet showing how form validation is handled:

Security Considerations
-----------------------

* Use HTTPS to secure JWT transmission.
* Store JWTs in HTTP-only cookies for enhanced security.
* Regularly rotate JWT secret keys.
* Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
